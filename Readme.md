# Self-Driving Car

This repository features a behavior copying model for self-driving cars, where the car learns to imitate human driving behavior. The model uses user-trained `.h5` files for testing.

## Features
- Behavior copying using neural networks.
- Simulator based on a Udemy course.
- Trained models for steering and throttle prediction.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algamelomer/self-driving-car.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files
- `TrainingSimulation.py`: Script to train the model.
- `test_simulation.py`: Testing script for the simulator.

## Usage

To train the model:

```bash
python TrainingSimulation.py
```

To test the model:

```bash
python test_simulation.py
```
